# My Datacamp Completed Courses List

If you tried to check my [Datacamp profile](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/danielpalacio), you probably had to scroll a lot to see all the courses I completed. Also, since the courses aren't displayed in a certain order, you most likely had some trouble getting a good picture of the subjects I learned so far. 

For these reasons, I decided to create a Spider to perform *web scraping* on that page, so that you can see the full course list in an organized way.
